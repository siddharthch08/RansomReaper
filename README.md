# ðŸ›¡ RansomReaper --> Ransomware Detector (Hybrid GUI + Heuristics)

##  Introduction  
**RansomReaper** is a **cross-platform ransomware early detection tool** that combines a **Tkinter GUI** with **heuristics-based detection logic**.  
It monitors specified folders in **real-time** for suspicious file activity and alerts you when potential ransomware behavior is detected.  

Unlike aggressive tools that quarantine on any file change, this detector uses **smart heuristics** to minimize false positives while still responding quickly to genuine threats.  

---

##  Features  

- **Real-time Monitoring**  
  Monitors one or more folders using the `watchdog` library.

- ** Heuristics-Based Detection**  
  - **Event Rate** â€” Detects unusually high number of file changes in a short time.  
  - **Extension Changes** â€” Flags mass renames like `.txt â†’ .locked`.  
  - **Entropy Checks** â€” Detects encrypted-looking files.  
  - **Honeypot Triggers** â€” Special folder that, if modified, triggers a high-confidence alert.  

- **Process Mapping**  
  Identifies processes that are modifying watched files using `psutil`.

- **Optional Auto-Response**  
  - **Auto-Quarantine** â€” Moves suspicious files to a secure quarantine folder.  
  - **Auto-Kill** â€” Terminates processes suspected of ransomware activity.  

- **GUI + CLI Modes**  
  - **GUI Mode** â€” Tkinter interface with Start/Stop controls and live activity logs.  
  - **Headless CLI Mode** â€” Ideal for servers or remote monitoring.  

- **Simulation Mode**  
  Safe testing mode that simulates ransomware-like activity.

- **Incident Reports**  
  Saves detailed incident logs including suspected processes, files, and detection stats.

##  Usage  

### **GUI Mode (Default)**  
```bash
python RansomReaper.py
```

```bash
python RansomReaper.py --nogui
```

### **Simulate Ransomware Activity (Safe Test)**  
```bash
python RansomReaper.py --simulate --simulate-dir ./sim_target
```

### **Custom Watch Paths**  
```bash
python RansomReaper.py --watch "C:/MyFolder" "/home/user/projects"
```

### **Enable Auto-Quarantine & Auto-Kill ( Dangerous)**  
```bash
python RansomReaper.py --auto-quarantine --auto-kill
```

##  How Detection Works  

1. **File Monitoring** â†’ Watches for file creation, modification, movement, and renames.  
2. **Heuristic Analysis** â†’ Every few seconds, calculates:  
   - Number of events  
   - Extension changes count  
   - Average entropy of modified files  
3. **Suspicious Behavior Trigger** â†’ If thresholds are exceeded, an alert is triggered.  
4. **Response Actions** â†’ Logs the event, creates an incident report, optionally kills processes and quarantines files.

##  Disclaimer  

This tool is provided **for educational and defensive purposes only**.  
- Do **NOT** use it to target or interfere with systems without permission.  
- Always test in a controlled environment before using in production.  
- Auto-kill and auto-quarantine modes can disrupt legitimate processes and should be enabled **only with caution**.  
- No security tool is 100% effective â€” use as part of a layered defense strategy with backups and endpoint protection.
